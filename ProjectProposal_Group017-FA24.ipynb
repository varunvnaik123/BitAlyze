    "In recent years, social media has changed the way information spreads, and it’s even had a big impact on financial markets. This is especially true for the cryptocurrency market and Bitcoin in particular. Because Bitcoin is decentralized and its price is highly volatile, it’s more sensitive to public opinion and speculation. Platforms like Twitter and Reddit have become central spaces where people express their views about Bitcoin, often influencing its price. A famous example of this is how Elon Musk’s tweets can send Bitcoin prices soaring or dropping, showing just how much social media sentiment can drive market behavior[^1](\"#1\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous studies have looked into this connection between social media sentiment and Bitcoin prices, and they’ve uncovered some interesting patterns. One notable study used Twitter data to gauge “public mood” and see how it affects Bitcoin price volatility. They found that major price shifts often happened in response to swings in public sentiment on Twitter. By analyzing the positive and negative tones of tweets, this study showed a significant link between these sentiments and Bitcoin’s price changes, particularly when the market was very volatile[^2](\"#2\"). Another study looked at Reddit’s cryptocurrency discussions, analyzing how the amount and sentiment of posts impacted Bitcoin prices. They observed that sudden increases in positive or negative discussions were often followed by price changes, suggesting that social media sentiment can lead to short-term trading behavior that affects prices[^3](\"#3\").\n",
    "\n",
    "While a lot of research has been done on Bitcoin’s price volatility and market trends, combining social media sentiment analysis with Bitcoin price prediction is still a developing area. This project aims to build on what we know by using sentiment analysis to measure the real-time impact of Twitter and Reddit on Bitcoin prices, hoping to see if we can make accurate price predictions based on sentiment trends. By mixing sentiment analysis with time series modeling, this project seeks to deepen our understanding of the relationship between social media and cryptocurrency markets, adding to ongoing research on how online platforms influence financial markets.\n",

Sentiment will be categorized as positive, neutral, or negative, using predefined sentiment analysis tools and sentiment scoring algorithms.\n"

A suitable source for this is the Kaggle dataset \"Bitcoin Historical Data\" (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data), which provides comprehensive price metrics over various time frames.\n",
    "- Social Media Sentiment Data: Sentiment data will be derived by scraping public posts related to Bitcoin on X and Reddit. Posts will be collected over a defined time frame corresponding to the Bitcoin price data. Sentiment will be categorized into positive, neutral, and negative using established sentiment analysis tools (e.g., VADER, TextBlob, or machine learning-based NLP methods). We will provide detailed documentation on data collection methods, preprocessing steps, and sentiment classification criteria.\n",
